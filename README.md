# Simple Hotel Booking System
This is a simple hotel booking project implemented in C++. This was made for my college first semester project. The program allows users to book hotel rooms, view available rooms, and cancel bookings.

## Features
- Booking Management: Users can book hotel rooms based on availability, room type, and desired dates.
- View Available Rooms: Users can view available rooms for every room type.
- Cancellation: Bookings can be canceled if needed.
- Basic User Interface: Simple command-line interface for app interaction.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard Template Library (STL) support
